Ansible Notes

25 Aug 2022
-something called ansibleTower -AWX (redhat)
-used to manage config on your servers
-what makes ansible standout is that it is agent-less 
-it does this by using ssh connection
-ansible control node is a server where u are controlling all servers in the pool (e.g. all the worker nodes, or all the databases, or all the mail servers, etc.)
-recall 3 private subnets: 192.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, or 10.x.x.x)
-in a real life setting, control has private IP, and u connect with VPN connection from private  subnet

-ansible recommended for: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
-can write linux script to do what ansibile does, but may require complex scripts
-play - ad hoc command, one time task u run from control node
-playbook - group of plays
-ansible-galaxy
-role - multiple playbooks
-module - task that ansible does each time u use it
-ansible use python for custom module
-prefer to use ubuntu for ansible since its comes with python3, whereas amazon 2 linux only comes with python2
-static vs dynamic inventory
-static inventory is for things that wont change like fax server, email server
-dynamic inventory is for things that change like ASG (autoscaling groups)
-modules and plugins in hidden file .ansible 
-by default ansible comes with like 200 modules? Probably change by now (750?)
-in company need to work with existing infrastructure. 
*TIP- never work with original config files
*TIP2- always make a copy before making changes
-no ansible.cfg, forks = 5 means 5 servers at a time, so locks it
-in linux, “uptime” show show long the server has been up
*has seen server run like 7 years, some can be long time, especially on prem servers
*REMEMBER AWK VS SED
-difference between command and shell, is that command does not take special characters like “>>” or “|”
*TIP3 NEVER SAVE ANYTHING INTO UR ETC DIRECTORY
-”-b” is escalate privilege, run as sudo
-need “-b” for write permission like restart, but not read permission like status
-ansible, since configuration manager, uses a lot of linux (*me: while modules use python?)
*What are way of troubleshooting linux system?  ‘df -h’
-by default, ansible uses the ad-hoc module, so dont need -m anything, and it will paste the commands as is on the nodes
-might be better to have our own ansible user no matter the OS
*NODES DO NOT NEED ANSIBLE FOR THIS TO WORK!!! AGENTLESS EZ Clap
*jeff geerling great at ansible
-absent - remove/delete
-present - install
-latest - install/upgrade to latest version
-package module is a python script that extracts the operating system and *me: Generalizes things
-last thing can have own inventory, and real life scenario, use own inventory
-vars are ansible variables, NOT SIMPLE LINUX ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

-need addresses to call nodes, or call as a group
-playbook written in yaml format
-PLAYBOOK contains plays, which contain tasks, which call modules
-tasks run sequentially
-inventory.ini files contains all ur nodes
-module also referred to as “tasks plugins” or “library plugins”
-modules should be idempotent, 

-SO to initialize, can use /etc/ansible/hosts file or use inventory.txt file, but need ansible.config file to specify if u want to use inventory.txt (this is more common)
-use -i flag to use inventory 
-”ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt playbook1.yml”
-terraform file creates separate inventory file (need to specify inventory.txt file)
Me: inventory pretty much holds all the nodes, ansible variables, etc, to do this stuff
Me: i believe adhoc/CLI command use linux, while with playbook we are using yaml
i believe adhoc/CLI commands we used yesterday, we used linux commands like systemctl, while with playbook we are using yaml syntax,

-secrets manager for ansible
-before secrets manager, something else was used: sem parameter storage
-kms is encryption, not secrets manager
-*interview question: HOW DO U MANAGE SENSITIVE INFORMATION in x, y, z.
-dynamic inventory is for things that will change
-dynamic inventory: using aws_ec2 plugin to manage ansible client dynamically
-QUESTION: by default how many elastic IP can u have (equal to the number of vpcs by default): 5
-500 limit for IAM role
-if limit is reached, need to reach to support to get limit increased
-facts are metadata u get from clients
-for variables, hostvars vs groupvars
-hostvars: host specific variables (unique to host)
-groupvars: group specific variables (by tag.OS: redhat, ubuntu)
-can group by environment stage, or by OS, or by other stuff
-again hostnamectl to change name of linux server
Interview QUESTION: what is metadata server on aws: 169.254.169.254
Interview question: how would u print something on terminal cli?  Debug: msg: (while running)
Me: if u are trying to ssh using another local bash window, u may need to ssh with public ip instead

-ansible role is like docker image, aws launch template; basically allows reusability
*Interview question: Explain role directory structure:
-Role vs Collection
-Role: set of tasks built into a role with custom vars and etc.
-Collection: set of roles, plugins, modules

-we will install terraform one ec2, give it iam role, and then run from there
-add auto to name.auto.tfvars so terraform will automatically load them
-never ever put aws secret/access keys in repo
-in this case we use IAM roles instead of aws secret/access keys
-have both variables.tf and tfvars to parameterize variables
-protocol: -1 means all the protocols
-id_rsa is private, while id_rsa.pub is public
"By default, when you execute a role, it looks for a file named main.yml in the tasks subdirectory and executes all the tasks listed within it."

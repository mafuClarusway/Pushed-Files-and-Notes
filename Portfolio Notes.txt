For projects:
*keep digging and don’t give up
*share knowledge

Framework: streamline of web services to make it actually work (like databases, code for the website, etc.) 
-analogy is if u need to write something, framework can be the provided pencil and table

-flask with python does not need to compile

-each route needs to be defined and assigned to a path

-jinja allows using html as response instead of just strings

-when using dynamic linking with html files with flask, need to place “templates” and the app.py on the same hierarchy

11 may 2022:
*may be assigned project due in a week, can work with team
-one job of flask to grab inputs
-AWS has something like eldap called cognito (Query string)
-path name of file you are accessing
-parameters within query string determine settings of page (list of key value pairs separated by ampersand) 
-anchor is sort of bookmark, specific spot on page

-remember with render template parameters (e.g. x=y)  left side is the variable that gets sent to html, and right is the value

-redirect and url_for library allow for redirecting links

-can use html code inline python app file, but most developer prefer put in separate file and use ginji

-if you have decorator and specified path, it will override the dynamic path (i.e. any path name thats not specified)

HTTP Methods:
Get: ask for a specific document (can be cached, and remain in browser history, restriction on data length)
Post: send request to update data (never cache, not remain in browser history, browser can keep data by some applications (e.g. password manager))
Delete: delete specified resources
Head: ask for information about document not the document itself (metadata)
Put: used to send data to a server to update resource (multiple requests only get one resource while post can get multiple resources)

-if we need an input from user, we will use POST method

-if previous process already running, use “ps -ef | grep python” to find active process and then “kill -9 *numbers*”

EC2 Userdata Notes:
-first thing to do when get into an EC2 for the first time is to update (e.g. sudo yum update -y)
-apache follows folder (/var/www/) to deploy application
-”sudo yum install httpd -y” (dont forget -y)
-click raw on github for the raw address to access it
-”sudo wget ${FOLDER}cat0.jpg” to grab files
-”sudo systemctl start httpd” to start apache
CloudFormation Notes:
-teraform is one of the most popular in the field (we will learn later and focus for now on CFN)
-AWS template version: AWS version so that it knows how to read file
-Description: human readable description of template; in Devops recommend to write good comments others can understand.  Use pipe “|” if u want to write more than one line.
*My thoughts: keep descriptions/comments simple, short, and easy to understand or else it’s just a bunch of gibberish no one will want to read or try to understand.
-Parameters: stuff u can set
-Metadata: by default some metadata is generated, but this is for more
-parameter vs mapping: parameter defined by users, but users dont see mappings.  Mappings decided by values depending on region or machine type, etc.
-conditions: allow to use logic based resources to modify values.  Can create different environments within the infrastructure depending on conditions.
-resources: single most important section, since primary job is to provision the resources.  Resources are the ONLY required part of the CFN template.  2 main part, type and properties.
-output: can do shortcut like ec2 ip or somethin

-some companies prefer dedicated host and not using AWS resources
-validate template in designer
-need to change github link and something else? 
-Need to go over VOD cuz slacking lol
-need to change name

-”cat /etc/os-release” to find out OS info
-with debian need to update and upgrade as well?
To access project resources:
-need to “sudo yum update -y”
-”sudo yum install git -y”
-”git clone https://github.com/serdarcw/linux_project.git”
-”ls -al” a for hidden, l for list of info
-will learn how to backup, learn to create userpassword, string manipulation, get data from log files or big data.
-Part 1: need to focus how to grab desired information
-Part 2: user and password script
-Part 3: Cronjob and backup
-Part 4: String manipulation

-recommend if write a shell script, write aim or purpose at the beginning of the script

-”watch -n5 ls: to watch folder every 5 second”
-to deploy backup: “sudo tar -xzvf /mnt/backup/ip-172-31-24-188-2022_05_25_02_26_AM.tgz”
-in a pipeline cannot manually edit files, can only put in some commands to automate it since we do not touch the files themselves directly
-”uniq -c” gives count of unique values

-before using userdata, try applying the commands 1 by 1 in an EC2 instance just to test it
-devs usually use “manage.py” instead of “app.py”
-userdata is first executed from root directory, so need to go to home ec2-user directory
-user curly braces for variable 
-linux “bg” + “jobs” to keep process running in background
-new shell will not have environment variables (again, they are temporary) need bashrc file
-generally use i am role to connect s3 bucket with ec2 instance, ec2 instance need role to fully access s3 bucket
-${AWS::Stackname} to access what user input in CFN
-do not need sudo in userdata, b/c aws executes in root privilege
-using amazon CLI inside ec2, if we create resources, it will create those for our account
-check ClassExampleAWSCLIcommands.txt for Amazon CLI code to create and remove security group/EC2

*PHONEBOOK APP PROJECT SESSIONS
-Phonebook project: setup cloudformation template, and use autoscaling group, security group, RDS database
-can link multiple machines to one DNS to display app/website, and using the Application Load Balancer which protects from downed instances among other things, preventing potential traffic problems
-autoscaling group will create/reduce new machines based on workload
-in project we can just use default vpc, but for real projects, prefer to create and use a VPC generally
-generally prefer to put EC2 instance, RDS in private subnet, while ALB in public subnet, need to protect ec2 instance/rds like a chess player
-need to give a template to autoscaling group to make new machines (launch template)
-which kind of host/VM is used for RDS?   Its created on ec2 instance actually
-hard part of application is database endpoint
-use private github repo for this project, need to use token to reach it
-recommended to run the APP before cloudformation or CLI on testing environment, to ensure the app runs perfectly
-can be tricky to get database endpoint during app creation, so need to read it within the CFN
-the two lines db_endpoint control this process of getting this database endpoint
*EXAM QUESTION: how many subnets for application load balancer at least?  2
-in our environment need to restrict traffic to the ec2 instances, allow only alb
-basically create a security group for ALB, and use that group name for the ec2 instances
-for ec2, instead of 0.0.0.0/0, we use ALBSecGroup on port 80
-same usage for RDS, only ec2 instances reach rds instance
-only VM with EC2SecGroup can reach RDS on port 3306
-as devops we can use our own IP to test things, but in production environment, we want to protect ec2 instances/RDS with security groups
-in practice, ALB should have ports open of both the target group and the listener

26 Apr 2022:
-things are moving to serverless, but EC2 still popular and big part of AWS
-ec2 essentially virtual machine in cloud
-purpose type models (memorize):
Burstable (T)
General (M)
Computer Optimized (C)
Memory Optimized (R)
Storage Optimized (D)
By default, every incoming connection is blocked

Every security group rule is stateful, meaning only need to specify inbound rules 
0.0.0.0/0 everything else (internet)

—----------------------
IAM USERS - 28 Apr 2022
-deny permission is default and takes precedence over allow
-AWS managed policies: default settings created by AWS
-customer managed policies: custom settings created by each account for user groups
-inline policies: custom settings assigned to a single account or group

YAML vs JSON (data serialization languages used for storing data):
-yaml is case sensitive
-serialization takes some language and makes it human or machine readable
-YAML
-| pipe for new line, > for space
-hyphen “-” used to indicate start of a list item
-tab not allowed so use spaces?
-no way to comment in JSON
-JSON:
	-everything in quotes except numbers, and booleans, and null?
	-square bracket “[ ]” indicates array
	-curly bracket “{ }” indicates object
-for web-apps, most likely strictly using JSON, which is used primarily to transmit data between server and web application
-should be able to convert between JSON and YAML easily
-JSON more tedious to type but more well defined with clear-cut rules
-use converter to make YAML into JSON files!!
-YAML slim and flexible, better for configuration, while JSON rigid, better for data interchange

Cloud Formation:
-console useful but not good for large scale
-CloudFormation is recommended

-NGINX- open source web server
-its a web tier that connects users to app servers (which are connected to DB)
-need to know how to spin up ec2 and setup html nginx web server
-also need to know how to use bash script to automate above
-ec2 needs to allow security group rule: html port 80 (ssh port 22)
-w/ amazon linux 2, to start a service, do sudo systemctl
-when curling to check a web page, can use public IP or public DNS
-sudo systemctl enable nginx to enable launch on startup
-”-xe” option for bin bash automation command will show used commands in the system log

14 May 2022
-when run out of space what should we do?
-for cool colors in linux: export PS1="\e[1;31m[\u@\h \W]$ \e[0m"
-*CHECK WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IP 12:29PM
-if you reboot instance, it will unmount new drives
-linux os uses a file called fstab (file system tab).  When the system reboots, linux will check this file, and then mount files based on it, so we should edit this file.
-UUID: universally unique id
-best practice, make backup copy of important file before editing it
-info on fstab: https://wiki.debian.org/fstab
-*REMEMBER TO UNMOUNT: sudo umount -a
-cannot unmount main (root) volume, as that will automatically terminate with the instance

ELB: elastic load balancing
-redirect traffic like traffic cops
-two components: listener (analyzer), and configurations (series of rules)
-4 types: application (layer 7), network (layer 4), classic (both, but outdated), and gateway (new, all ports, used for appliances)
-health check keeps track of application status
-hands-on 3 problems: DNS problem, …
-user data settings under EC2, uses root privilege so u do not need to write sudo or anything
-AWS lets us grab meta data of ec2 using token
-recall, need to start command, but also enable command (which restarts on startup)
-httpd is apache
-tokens to access metadata usually have expiration date of 4 hours
-target group needs to follow same port as applications.
-404 is problem, unhealthy report, 200 means running well, okay
-need to attach target group to ALB or it wont track EC2 instances
-best practice to select all AZ’s (subnets), incase some go down
-sometimes your application may be running on different port than its serving, in that time we need to use security group for both ports
-listener can redirect traffic based on paths
-ALB creates a DNS name for you (AWESOME!!)
-For Target Group Attributes, recommend least outstand requests over round robin for load balancing algorithm

23 May 2022
-topic AMI’s and snapshots
-3 types of AMI: public, private, paid
-snapshot is a point in time copy of either EBS (memory) or the instance itself (EC2)
-use of snapshot:
	-backups
	-create an ami
	-create a volume
-snapshot is incremental storage and stored in amazon s3
-if u delete a snapshot, it can still rebuild the ec2 instance or volume
-retention: how many days a snapshot goes back
-loading more on an AMI leads to simplicity (everything already set?), loading less is flexibility (for future programs)
-easy to build ami, go to the console and type build ami! 
-remember to install wget for html sites: “yum install wget -y”
-if u choose storage less than original with an AMI, it should fail
*snapshot is a copy, nor directions to make a copy, it is the copy after all the installing and userdata has been done
-another tool sits on top of lifecycle manager called AWS backup, which may be used instead

25 May 2022
Storage options: file storage, object storage, block storage
-advantage of file storage is hierarchical structure and ease of sharing
-advantage of object storage is storing large amount of unorganized data
-advantage of block storage is processing time as each file is split across multiple blocks
-5 tb normal S3 single file limit, but on AWS console, 160gb is the limit
-by default aws replicate data across 3 AZ
-S3 has static website hosting, not dynamic, so no server, database, or application code 

26 May 2022
-vertical scaling: modifying the current instance configuration
-horizontal scaling: multiples the current amount of instances
-desired capacity is the goal as a result of all the policies set, and the actual capacity will reach that goal
-load balancer listens to request on port 80 and forwards anything to the target group

2 June 2022
-even within its own services, AWS requires us to grant access in order to replicate bucket, thus we need an IAM role.
-IAM policies cannot be retrieved by instances or anything so must be attached to a role
-always clean up resources (buckets, role, policies) after done using/testing, as can always make them again

28 May 2022 (missed class)
-load balancer bridge traffic from external to internal, includes the ui
-scaling out vs scaling in (increase # of instance or decrease behind the load balancer)
-auto scaling also monitors the health and replace impaired instances
-any time need to build a system or architecture, DRAW IT OUT!!!


8 June 2022
-don't need public IP if on same subnet (to connect to AWS Database)
-manual DB snapshot if doing a big change
-a restored DB is a new instance
-cannot shrink DB size
-can restore DB via point in time snapshot or by manual snapshot
-when backing up via manual commands, can affect original database and do single databases at a time

11 June 2022
VPC: logically  isolated area where you can launch aws resources in a virtual network that you define
-some resources dont run inside vpc, (e.g. S3, dynamoDB, IAM)
-VPC belong to a single region, but can span multiple availability zones (AZ’s)
-VPC subnet is in one single AZ
-once you set VPC CIDR, you cannot remake or change base CIDR block
-subnet CIDR range cannot change at all
-*FOR EXAM* need to know difference between sec group and NACL
-public subnet means things on that subnet can go out to the internet, but a private subnet cannot have direct access to the internet
-3 things to access internet: public IP, public subnet, correct sec groups open
-for private subnet, need NAT gateway?
-CIDR: classless inter-domain routing, base address + blocksides
-remember some IP’s are allocated
-ec2 on private subnet do not have access to internet through internet gateway.  They need to go through a NAT gateway.
-again, it is PRIVATE because no direct access to the internet through IGW, it needs something else, i.e. NAT gateway
-its the route table (slash router) that decide whether a subnet is private or public
-route table is a set of rules that decide where traffic is directed, one job: “next hop”
-NACL subnet based, while sec group is instance-based
-NACL is stateless
-security groups are statefull
-if non intended for internet traffic is sent to IGW, it will just reject it

-**REMEMBER 3 THINGS TO CONNECT: Security groups, public IP, and PUBLIC SUBNET (what we learned today)

13 June 2022
-instances that need private zone: databases, etc
-NAT gateway so instances in private subnet can connect to services outside to update and stuff
-NAT gateway should reside in the public subnet
-in a nutshell NAT gateway gives things in private subnet access to the internet
-NAT instance was old method on AWS, superseded by the NAT gateway
-bastion host or jump box, is a server to provide access to a private network from external/internal network
-within a VPC, all instances have connectivity to each other
-best practice with bastion host: ssh agent forwarding
-NAT gateway hosted on public subnet

15 Jun 2022
-VPC endpoint allows privately connect VPC to AWS services, a shortcut, without going through internet
-VPC peering connects two VPC’s, allows direct connection between instances in different endpoints
-2 common remote connectivity option is VPN and direct connect
-2 VPN, site-to-site or client VPN
-VPN happens through internet
-direct connect endpoint allows quicker and non public direct access to AWS services

16 Jun 2022
-DNS translate human readable domain names to machine readable IP addresses
-Route 53 has 3 key function: routing, DNS health checks, domain name registration
-TTL is caching time

22 Jun 2022
-goal of cloudfront is to improve performance and provide faster distribution of web content

Elastic Beanstalk:
-elastic beanstalk is example of platform as a service (everything but data/app is automated)
-AWS is example of infrastructure as a service
-lambda function is example of function as a service
-google drive/facebook as example of software as a service
-elastic beanstalk handles many aspects of app deployment
-beanstalk does a lot more than CFN, CFN is simply provision resource, while beanstalk can directly deal with app deployment
-elastic beanstalk is a collection of environments, application versions, and configurations
-environment is a collection of AWS resources
-2 environment tiers: web app tier, and a backend work environment tier
-need to handle all configuration under elastic beanstalk (not edit ec2 itself)

Boto3:
-boto3 is a python sdk for amazon webservices
-enables to create, update and delete AWS resource with python scripts, basically a python library
-2 most commonly used features of boto3 are client and resources
-client is more low level, while resource is high level, object oriented API

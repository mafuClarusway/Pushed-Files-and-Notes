26 Apr 2022:
-things are moving to serverless, but EC2 still popular and big part of AWS
-ec2 essentially virtual machine in cloud
-purpose type models (memorize):
Burstable (T)
General (M)
Computer Optimized (C)
Memory Optimized (R)
Storage Optimized (D)
By default, every incoming connection is blocked

Every security group rule is stateful, meaning only need to specify inbound rules 
0.0.0.0/0 everything else (internet)

—----------------------
IAM USERS - 28 Apr 2022
-deny permission is default and takes precedence over allow
-AWS managed policies: default settings created by AWS
-customer managed policies: custom settings created by each account for user groups
-inline policies: custom settings assigned to a single account or group

YAML vs JSON (data serialization languages used for storing data):
-yaml is case sensitive
-serialization takes some language and makes it human or machine readable
-YAML
-| pipe for new line, > for space
-hyphen “-” used to indicate start of a list item
-tab not allowed so use spaces?
-no way to comment in JSON
-JSON:
	-everything in quotes except numbers, and booleans, and null?
	-square bracket “[ ]” indicates array
	-curly bracket “{ }” indicates object
-for web-apps, most likely strictly using JSON, which is used primarily to transmit data between server and web application
-should be able to convert between JSON and YAML easily
-JSON more tedious to type but more well defined with clear-cut rules
-use converter to make YAML into JSON files!!
-YAML slim and flexible, better for configuration, while JSON rigid, better for data interchange

Cloud Formation:
-console useful but not good for large scale
-CloudFormation is recommended

-NGINX- open source web server
-its a web tier that connects users to app servers (which are connected to DB)
-need to know how to spin up ec2 and setup html nginx web server
-also need to know how to use bash script to automate above
-ec2 needs to allow security group rule: html port 80 (ssh port 22)
-w/ amazon linux 2, to start a service, do sudo systemctl
-when curling to check a web page, can use public IP or public DNS
-sudo systemctl enable nginx to enable launch on startup
-”-xe” option for bin bash automation command will show used commands in the system log

-when run out of space what should we do?
-for cool colors in linux: export PS1="\e[1;31m[\u@\h \W]$ \e[0m"
-*CHECK WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IP 12:29PM
-if you reboot instance, it will unmount new drives
-linux os uses a file called fstab (file system tab).  When the system reboots, linux will check this file, and then mount files based on it, so we should edit this file.
-UUID: universally unique id
-best practice, make backup copy of important file before editing it
-info on fstab: https://wiki.debian.org/fstab
-*REMEMBER TO UNMOUNT: sudo umount -a
-cannot unmount main (root) volume, as that will automatically terminate with the instance

ELB: elastic load balancing
-redirect traffic like traffic cops
-two components: listener (analyzer), and configurations (series of rules)
-4 types: application (layer 7), network (layer 4), classic (both, but outdated), and gateway (new, all ports, used for appliances)
-health check keeps track of application status
-hands-on 3 problems: DNS problem, …
-user data settings under EC2, uses root privilege so u do not need to write sudo or anything
-AWS lets us grab meta data of ec2 using token
-recall, need to start command, but also enable command (which restarts on startup)
-httpd is apache
-tokens to access metadata usually have expiration date of 4 hours
-target group needs to follow same port as applications.
-404 is problem, unhealthy report, 200 means running well, okay
-need to attach target group to ALB or it wont track EC2 instances
-best practice to select all AZ’s (subnets), incase some go down
-sometimes your application may be running on different port than its serving, in that time we need to use security group for both ports
-listener can redirect traffic based on paths
-ALB creates a DNS name for you (AWESOME!!)
-For Target Group Attributes, recommend least outstand requests over round robin for load balancing algorithm

-topic AMI’s and snapshots
-3 types of AMI: public, private, paid
-snapshot is a point in time copy of either EBS (memory) or the instance itself (EC2)
-use of snapshot:
	-backups
	-create an ami
	-create a volume
-snapshot is incremental storage and stored in amazon s3
-if u delete a snapshot, it can still rebuild the ec2 instance or volume
-retention: how many days a snapshot goes back
-loading more on an AMI leads to simplicity (everything already set?), loading less is flexibility (for future programs)
-easy to build ami, go to the console and type build ami! 
-remember to install wget for html sites: “yum install wget -y”
-if u choose storage less than original with an AMI, it should fail
*snapshot is a copy, nor directions to make a copy, it is the copy after all the installing and userdata has been done
-another tool sits on top of lifecycle manager called AWS backup, which may be used instead

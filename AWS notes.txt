26 Apr 2022:
-things are moving to serverless, but EC2 still popular and big part of AWS
-ec2 essentially virtual machine in cloud
-purpose type models (memorize):
Burstable (T)
General (M)
Computer Optimized (C)
Memory Optimized (R)
Storage Optimized (D)
By default, every incoming connection is blocked

Every security group rule is stateful, meaning only need to specify inbound rules 
0.0.0.0/0 everything else (internet)

YAML vs JSON (data serialization languages used for storing data):
-yaml is case sensitive
-serialization takes some language and makes it human or machine readable
-YAML
-| pipe for new line, > for space
-hyphen “-” used to indicate start of a list item
-tab not allowed so use spaces?
-no way to comment in JSON
-JSON:
	-everything in quotes except numbers, and booleans, and null?
	-square bracket “[ ]” indicates array
	-curly bracket “{ }” indicates object
-for web-apps, most likely strictly using JSON, which is used primarily to transmit data between server and web application
-should be able to convert between JSON and YAML easily
-JSON more tedious to type but more well defined with clear-cut rules
-use converter to make YAML into JSON files!!
-YAML slim and flexible, better for configuration, while JSON rigid, better for data interchange

Cloud Formation:
-console useful but not good for large scale
-CloudFormation is recommended

-NGINX- open source web server
-its a web tier that connects users to app servers (which are connected to DB)
-need to know how to spin up ec2 and setup html nginx web server
-also need to know how to use bash script to automate above
-ec2 needs to allow security group rule: html port 80 (ssh port 22)
-w/ amazon linux 2, to start a service, do sudo systemctl
-when curling to check a web page, can use public IP or public DNS
-sudo systemctl enable nginx to enable launch on startup
-”-xe” option for bin bash automation command will show used commands in the system log

-when run out of space what should we do?
-for cool colors in linux: export PS1="\e[1;31m[\u@\h \W]$ \e[0m"
-*CHECK WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IP 12:29PM
-if you reboot instance, it will unmount new drives
-linux os uses a file called fstab (file system tab).  When the system reboots, linux will check this file, and then mount files based on it, so we should edit this file.
-UUID: universally unique id
-best practice, make backup copy of important file before editing it
-info on fstab: https://wiki.debian.org/fstab
-*REMEMBER TO UNMOUNT: sudo umount -a
-cannot unmount main (root) volume, as that will automatically terminate with the instance

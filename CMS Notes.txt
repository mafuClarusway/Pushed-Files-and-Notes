-USE EXAMPLES IN INTERVIEWS, SO IMPORTANT.
-do research phase (research on company and job description)

1) assesss skills (current vs future)
2) select skills to add/improve
3) Goal + action plan

-sometimes getting past first and second interview is hardest (INTERPERSONAL + TRANSFERRABLE SKILLS!!)

STAR TECHNIQUE (me: YEP important)
-way to answer difficult behavior questions
Situation - describe and background the situation
Task - outline task
Action - most detailed
Results - should always be positive following actions
can add on another R, Reflection: what changes would make for next time

*MAKE SURE I DEPLOY PROJECTS
*TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEORY BEFORE HANDS ON (i think this is my strength?)
-whenever u hear microservices, means containers
-idea of Docker is that it's easy to replace containers
-disadvantage of container, is if host operating system goes down, all containers go down
-docker daemon backend
-docker cli frontend
-rest api connects the twos
-try to stick with official Docker images
*can run multiple containers on one EC2
-*interview if u want to interactively access running docker container, use “it”
-can “harden” docker images for security
-separation of duties, always do things on seperate servers
-recall, systemctl enable means it can autostart on restart
-docker-compose to build multistage docker images
*interview question: managing many accounts with CFN, use stack sets
*another question: can create terraform or cloudformation with null resource if need to run something and get outputs
*3 private subnets 10.0.0, 172, 198?
-for CFN documentation, look at return values (important) [for terraform its output values]
-for output, need export name to use in another cfn stack
*another ?: how would u use nested values in cfn?  Outputs
-flags -i and -t will go into the docker container
*me: docker containers are so barebones, they dont even have vim!!

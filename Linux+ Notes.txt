-printenv, env, echo ($), set, to find environment variables
-EXPORT to create envoriment/global variables
-unset to delete variable (but remember set is not to create, but find variable)
-any time new software installed, PATH variable should be updated

-Command not found means either not installed or not in the path (special environment variable)
-yum needs just update, and use autoremove
-apt needs update and upgrade, and remove works entirely

-”cat /etc/passwd” for user file
-tee outputs to screen and file at same time
-grem is a filter to find lines with patterns
-cut deals with finding columns of data based on delimiter and column number 
-tr (translate) used to change one character to another
-later use sed to replace multiple characters
-wc counts lines (-l), words (-w), characters (-c)
-uniq is case sensitive (as is most things by default) and only compares files next to each other, need to sort before
-sort ignores case by default (for some reason)
-can pipe through multiple pipes, each one having different input and output streams
-comm shows in common, file 1 col 1, fil 2 col 2, whats in common col 3.

-hands on examples:
“cat mylist.txt | sort | tr [A-Z] [a-z] |  uniq”
“cat countries.csv | cut -d"," -f3 | tail -4 | sort | uniq | tee continents.txt “
” cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 | sort”

Control operators:
-semicolon “;” ro run more than one command in a single line
-”&” means run in background
-”$?” Checks exit code of last command (0 mean is worked, anything else is the error code)
-”&&” and, “||” or, both for if else, “#” as comment

-for error code, look at manpage or help file of the used command
-&& and only runs if first command succeeds
-|| or only runs if first command fails
-\ escape character that tells system to treat the next character as-is and not interpret

-example if then statement:
“find clarusway.txt && cat clarusway.txt || echo Too early/!”

-Again two way to do same thing:
-cat file.txt | grep pattern
-grep pattern file.txt
-should give similar results if not exact

-”-i” flag for case insensitivity in grep
-to delete with translate “tr”, need -d flag because cannot use empty string as argument
-cat << “end of file code” > file.txt

-#! stands for shebang and is not a comment anymore but for scripting
-can use any extension but typically .sh (represent shell script)
-”-e” option aborts script at first error (except in loops, if, etc.)
-”-v” print command to stdout before executing
-”-x” similar to -v but expands commands
-just cause change extension does not give allow it to be executed, need to change permissions with chmod
-”./” to execute script, it explicitly says search path here
-to not require command, can add to path, “export PATH=$PATH:./”
-startup script is .bashrc and .bash_profile
-variable important part of scripts, refer to with $
-special inscript variables: (*REMEMBER THESE)
$0: name of script
$1-$9: first 9 arg to script
$#: how many arg were passed to script
$@: all the arg supplied to script
$?: exit status of most recent ran process
$$: process ID of current script
-expr command to print arithmetic expression
-let command assigns to variable, can also use $(())
-VERIFY? Expr is $(()) and let is (())?
-to save output of command use $() or ` `
-array is a list with prespecified number of items (OHISEE)

*LIFE IS THE COMBINATION OF ALL OUR CHOICES, SIMILAR TO SCRIPTING, NEED DIRECTION
-linux relational operators for numbers are different than normal programming language:  -eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, -ge, -le
-string comparison use more conventional operator: =, !=, -z (empty string), -n (not empty string)
.-file test operators: -r, -w, -x, -d, -f, -e, -s
-end if statement with “fi”
-if statement format: if [[ $number -gt 10 ]]
-again -x in #!/bin/bash prints out the inputs
*A BIG PART OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IS PROBLEM SOLVING (troubleshooting?)
-very common thing to do with script: check number of parameters, and if its incorrect, exit or give a message.
-recall, to run system command, use “$(command)”
-echo with flag “-e” will treat escape characters correctly
-case statement is a cleaner way to write if, elif, elif, elif, …, else.

Incorrect: ping a machine and its down (not conclusive, could be ICMP disabled)
No networking protocol that uses hostname (for humans, machine performs DNS lookup to find IP from hostname)
50ms is high speed, any more, may have issues
Tracert for identifying bootlenecks
Good practice to always use FQDN: myserver.mydomain.com (not just host name)
Anything start with 127 is a loopback.
Everytime browser go to website, doing dns lookup (finding IP from host name)
Curl returns full page source of website

-layer VPN on top for security
-thus we want both direct connect with a VPN for both speed and security
-this is different then regular VPN and is actually called site-to-site VPN, to connect AWS with data center
-VPN is the tunnel, SSL/TLS is the encryption methodology to make the VPN tunnel
-0.0.0.0/0 doesnt only mean internet, but everything else

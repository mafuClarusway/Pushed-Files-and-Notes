Incorrect: ping a machine and its down (not conclusive, could be ICMP disabled)
No networking protocol that uses hostname (for humans, machine performs DNS lookup to find IP from hostname)
50ms is high speed, any more, may have issues
Tracert for identifying bootlenecks
Good practice to always use FQDN: myserver.mydomain.com (not just host name)
Anything start with 127 is a loopback.
Everytime browser go to website, doing dns lookup (finding IP from host name)
Curl returns full page source of website
